 Overview

For my final project I built a simple flappy bird game that has a bird that
represents the user and pipes that represent the obstacles

I wrote my code style according to c++ Google Style Guide 

Game Instructions

To play the game and exit main menu screen, press the 'p' button 
on your keyboard. Jump using the space bar. If your hit any one of the 
pipes the game is over and your final score is displayed. To play again 
you can press the tab button.
