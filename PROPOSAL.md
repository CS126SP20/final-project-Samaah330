# Flappy Bird Proposal

**Author**: Samaah Khan

Overview
- 
For my final project I am going to be doing a flappy bird game, and
I want to do this project because I think it would be fun to recreate 
a game that I used to play on my phone. For this project I will be a json library.

Rough timeline:
- 
* In the first week I will make the main menu screen, game state screen, and game over screen.
 I will also set up the pipes for the game. 
 
* In the second week I will create the moving ground and do the main functionality of the game 
including spawning new moving pipes and animating the bird. 

* In the third week I will write functionality to deal with collision of the bird with a 
pipe and I will display the score in the game over screen.

If Finished Early...

If I am finish with this assignment early, extensions that I can add to the 
game would be to create a more appealing background for the game with graphics,
keeping track of high scores, and allowing the user to choose and alter the difficulty 
level of the flappy bird game by changing the speed that the bird is moving at and
 increasing/decreasing the area the bird can fly through in between the pipes. 
 I can also add audio to the game if I have more time as well.
